Please find all details, the history and basic guides in the [Huhu-Backend](https://github.com/JanST123/Huhu)" repository here on github.


## What will I find in this repository?

In this repository you'll find the Huhu-**Frontend**, which is written in Javascript with Sencha Touch. It is optionally build with phonegap to run as an app on smartphone devices.

**Please note that there currently exists no guides, except for the comments in the code. But I'm working on it, and you'll 
find <u>some guides how to set up</u> here soon.**

You'll find a guide, how to setup and build the app here later. You can setup the backend on your dev machine or  you can use it on http://we-hu.hu/api/.
